I am a Certified Public Accountant who is looking to break into the cybersecurity and penetration testing field. I have passed the eJPT and I'm looking to obtain more certifications as I continue to study and learn. I enjoy penetration testing and I'm familiar and efficient with Kali Linux and related penetration testing tools. Hopefully this blog will be useful for those also studying and performing black boxes or other rooms.
